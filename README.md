## Zig Langauge is a low level programmer alternative C\C++

 My advice is to use Linux or Mac when you are learning Zig language. Windows PC may cause you to give up early and you donâ€™t know what the error you are facing is about sometimes. The date I wrote this article for the first time was 28/12/2023. I may update it in the future. To be honest, I am not sure what is wrong with the Windows PC when I run the same code that works well with Linux and macOS. There must be something missing in my Windows OS, maybe packages that are needed to work well with Zig language in Windows OS. I will update if I find out a solution. Maybe I am lacking some experience with Windows OS with Zig language.
